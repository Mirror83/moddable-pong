# Moddable Pong

This mini moddable game project by [Endless OS
Foundation](https://endlessos.org) is intended to help ease the learning curve
into Godot.

I am doing this as part of the first week's assignment in the
Godot track of the GameUp Africa Game Dev Bootcamp (2025).

This is a clone of the [original Endless OS Foundation repo](https://github.com/endlessm/moddable-pong).

This sample project allows learners to engage with game creation concepts,
applying various modifications to the game itself, all without reading or
writing any code.

The `doc/MODS.md` file details the mods that have been made available.

The modifications I have made include:

- Setting the ball velocity multiplier to 1.1 so that the ball gets a bit faster every time it hits a paddle.
- Changing the default background and paddle colours
- Adding start and game over screens
- Ending the game after a particular score is reached
